# Technologies

 Used **MERN stacks +Redux** as the developing technology

- Mongodb for Database 

- Node js for Backend 

- React and ReactRedux for Frontend

- Express as the Framework

I used **MERN** stacks because it is very good for quick development and it is ideal when developing high performanced, customized web applications. Because of the **MERN** Technology the webapp can be seperated in to two main components frontend and backend, in addition the Database system is isolated from the rest.
